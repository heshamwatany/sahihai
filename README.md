# Sahih AI

## A Sunnah Studies

***

### Introduction

After the huge development of AI and technology in recent years, we as Muslims should make sure that our Deen should be integrated and that we should start working on training AI models on our data. This will be an open-source project that people can contribute to and make studies and papers using this project.

Please note that I am not an AI professional, I am just a person who has ideas with a background in business, software engineering, product management, and media production. You can use my ideas, and you have the full rights to use them or edit them.

### Old Thought as a Child

I was always asking about Sunnah and how we know that a Hadith is from the prophet. As a child living in Egypt in the age of technology, I didn’t know who is that person that says they heard the prophet saying Hadith or heard someone that heard from the prophet.

I knew that there is a science behind it, [Biographical evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biographical_evaluation) (Arabic: عِلْمُ الرِّجال, romanized: ʿilm al-rijāl; literally meaning 'Knowledge of Men' also commenly referred to as al-jarḥ wa al-taʿdīl (discrediting and accrediting) which studies those people and how authentic they are and in which age range he was authentic or not, and many different aspects. Many details, still I was asking a big question, but nobody was having an answer to it.

But I think my question can soon or at least in the next 10 years can be answered. The question is, “Is there a percentage for each Hadith that says how much is it authentic?”

After seeing how technology reached this point of high-edge tech on AI language modules, and after seeing what Dr. Hazem Khaled has revealed in this repository [Sunnah GPT](https://github.com/hazemabdelkawy/SunnahGPT), we can use the amount of Hadith we have on a learning module to detect how much they are alike and what is the percentage of these Hadith to be said from the same person.

This could be the next Sahih Book Project “Sahih AI.” We should put in mind many features when training modules:

A person's way of talking might change during life (Prophet)
Some Hadiths are Prophet's words, some are actions, etc.
If this Hadith is said in a specific situation example: during the war talks might change according to the mental state of the war
Also, we should ask Hadith schoolers for other features that we should take in mind
The data should be normalized first, making it only the talks of the Prophet, and then rework according to the results.
The main important point is not to get biased by our belief of specific books are authentic more than others, it is a hard point to keep in mind while working, scientific logic work is the best way to work on this project.

### Challenges

* This cannot be done using supervised learning modules as we need the module to be agnostic to books and not biased.
* We can use unsupervised learning to detect patterns, like clustering or anomaly detection. (We should ask AI professionals)
* The amount of data to be normalized and made ready for the modules.
Gathering AI professionals with Islamic schoolers and all work under scientific methodologies with being biased.

### Steps to start this project

1. Define the scope and objectives of the project:
 - Define the problem statement: "Can we use AI to determine the authenticity of Hadiths?"
 - Set the project goals and objectives: To build an open-source AI model that can analyze and classify Hadiths based on their authenticity using unsupervised learning techniques.
 - Determine the project timeline, budget, and resources required.
2. Gather a team with diverse expertise:
 - Bring together a team of AI professionals, Islamic scholars, and experts in the field of Hadith studies.
 - Assign roles and responsibilities to team members based on their expertise.
3. Gather and normalize data:
 - Gather a large dataset of Hadiths from different sources.
 - Normalize the data by removing any irrelevant information and ensuring that it is in a format that can be processed by the AI model.
4. Determine the features and algorithms to be used:
 - Define the features that the AI model will analyze, such as the language used, the context in which the Hadith was spoken, and the source of the Hadith.
 - Select the unsupervised learning algorithms that will be used to analyze the data, such as clustering or anomaly detection.
5. Develop and train the AI model:
 - Develop the AI model using the selected algorithms and features.
 - Train the model using the normalized data.
 - Continuously monitor and evaluate the performance of the model and make adjustments as necessary.
6. Validate the model:
 - Validate the accuracy of the model by comparing its predictions to the known authenticity of a subset of the Hadiths in the dataset.
 - Continuously test and validate the model using new data.
7. Publish and share the results:
 - Publish the results of the project as an open-source software tool.
 - Encourage others to use the tool and contribute to its development.
 - Share the results of the project with the wider community through papers, conferences, and other forums.
8. Ensure scientific rigor and avoid bias:
 - Use scientific methodologies throughout the project, including data collection, normalization, and model development.
 - Avoid bias by ensuring that the model is agnostic to books and sources of the Hadiths and that the analysis is based on scientific logic rather than personal beliefs.

> By following these steps, the project can be started and developed with scientific rigor and community involvement.
