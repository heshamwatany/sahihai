# Sahih AI

## A Sunnah Studies

***

### Introduction

After the huge development of AI and technology in recent years, we as Muslims should make sure that our Deen should be integrated and that we should start working on training AI models on our data. This will be an open-source project that people can contribute to and make studies and papers using this project.

Please note that I am not an AI professional, I am just a person who has ideas with a background in business, software engineering, product management, and media production. You can use my ideas, and you have the full rights to use them or edit them.

### Old Thought as a Child

I was always asking about Sunnah and how we know that a Hadith is from the prophet. As a child living in Egypt in the age of technology, I didn’t know who is that person that says they heard the prophet saying Hadith or heard someone that heard from the prophet.

I knew that there is a science behind it, [Biographical evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biographical_evaluation) (Arabic: عِلْمُ الرِّجال, romanized: ʿilm al-rijāl; literally meaning 'Knowledge of Men' also commenly referred to as al-jarḥ wa al-taʿdīl (discrediting and accrediting) which studies those people and how authentic they are and in which age range he was authentic or not, and many different aspects. Many details, still I was asking a big question, but nobody was having an answer to it.

But I think my question can soon or at least in the next 10 years can be answered. The question is, “Is there a percentage for each Hadith that says how much is it authentic?”

After seeing how technology reached this point of high-edge tech on AI language modules, and after seeing what Dr. Hazem Khaled has revealed in this repository [Sunnah GPT](https://github.com/hazemabdelkawy/SunnahGPT), we can use the amount of Hadith we have on a learning module to detect how much they are alike and what is the percentage of these Hadith to be said from the same person.

This could be the next Sahih Book Project “Sahih AI.” We should put in mind many features when training modules:

A person's way of talking might change during life (Prophet)
Some Hadiths are Prophet's words, some are actions, etc.
If this Hadith is said in a specific situation example: during the war talks might change according to the mental state of the war
Also, we should ask Hadith schoolers for other features that we should take in mind
The data should be normalized first, making it only the talks of the Prophet, and then rework according to the results.
The main important point is not to get biased by our belief of specific books are authentic more than others, it is a hard point to keep in mind while working, scientific logic work is the best way to work on this project.

### Challenges

* This cannot be done using supervised learning modules as we need the module to be agnostic to books and not biased.
* We can use unsupervised learning to detect patterns, like clustering or anomaly detection. (We should ask AI professionals)
* The amount of data to be normalized and made ready for the modules.
Gathering AI professionals with Islamic schoolers and all work under scientific methodologies with being biased.
